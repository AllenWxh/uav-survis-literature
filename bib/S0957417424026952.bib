abstract = {The growth environment of litchis is complex, and there is a tendency for occlusion between litchis, which makes litchi detection difficult. The use of UAVs to detect litchi in complex natural environments is important for litchi yield estimation. In this paper, an improved You Only Look Once version 5 (YOLOv5) model YOLO-Litchi based on litchi images captured by UAVs is proposed, which can be used for litchi detection and yield estimation in orchards. We establish a dataset of litchi in the litchi orchard of South China Agricultural University (SCAU) using a DJI Elf 4 generation drone, and chose the YOLOv5s model as the base version of the improved model for litchi detection in complex natural environments. First, we add a small target detection layer for the characteristics of litchi targets in UAV images, so that the model can localize smaller targets and improve the detection performance of small targets. Second, we replace the C3 module C3TR with the C3 module C3TR incorporating a transformer at the end of the network backbone and add the ECA attention (Efficient Channel Attention) mechanism after the C3TR module to reduce the interference of invalid information in the background and enhance the ability of the network to extract litchi feature information. Finally, we replace the SiLU activation function in the original model with MemoryEfficientMish, a more efficient version of the Mish activation function that customizes the forward propagation and backpropagation, making its backpropagation more efficient. The effectiveness of the improvement is verified experimentally. The results show that the mAP and recall of the proposed model in this paper are improved by 1.5 % and 2.4 %, respectively, compared with the unimproved YOLOv5 network. Compared with object detection models such as SSD and YOLOv7, the model proposed in this paper also has better performance. In addition, our proposed model maintains the FPS of the model at 45.87 and the model size at 20.7 MB while improving the detection effect, which still meets the requirements of real-time detection as well as model lightweighting. In summary, the proposed model successfully balances speed, model size, and accuracy, meeting the needs of agricultural litchi detection. The improved litchi detection model is more robust, has higher detection accuracy, and is suitable for litchi recognition and yield estimation in field environments, which helps to refine the management of litchi plantations.}
